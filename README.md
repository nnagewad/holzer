# Random location generator

## About
- This project was inspired by the works of Jenny Holzer and Bruce Nauman.
- Both cities and country will change at random and are not at sync with one another.
- To add to that, refresh of both cities and countries is set to random. Thus, everytime this application is used there is no telling what the refresh rate would be for either.
- In doing so, this creates a sense of disorientation of what we come to understand both the geographic and political boundaries that has long been established by governing bodies.

## Data
- Data is coming from the Trending locations on Twitter, both city and country.

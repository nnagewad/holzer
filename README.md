# Random location generator

## About
- This project was inspired by the works of Jenny Holzer and Bruce Nauman.
- Both cities and country will change at random and are not at sync with one another.
- To add to that, refresh of both cities and countries is set to random. Thus, everytime this application is used there is no telling what the refresh rate would be for either.
- As a result, a combination is made that can contain a city and a country that cannot be found in any map.  
- In doing so, this creates a sense of disorientation of what we come to understand both the geographic and political boundaries that has long been established and agreed upon by governing bodies from around the world.

## Data
- Both cities and countries are from Twitter's list of locations which they use to show what is Trending in the user's location.
